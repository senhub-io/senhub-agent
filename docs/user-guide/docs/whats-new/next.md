### Hosts opted into betas now converge to the stable release

A host running `auto_update.include_beta: true` resolved `latest` to the newest
**beta** and stayed there — it never moved to the stable release that
superseded it. A recette host opted into betas silently stopped tracking
production.

Each channel is published with an alias record first, carrying the resolved
version (`{"latest", "0.5.3"}`, `{"latest-beta", "0.5.3-beta"}`), and the merge
of the two channels de-duplicates by version keeping the first record — so for
the newest release the alias record is usually the only one left. Version
selection then discarded records named `latest`, which made the newest stable
release invisible, while the beta alias, named `latest-beta`, escaped the same
filter and won.

Selection now looks at the version a record carries, never at the name of the
record. A beta genuinely ahead of the newest stable still wins, so opting into
betas keeps delivering them.

Stable hosts were never affected: they resolve `latest` through a different
path. (#730)
